// My name is Abigail Vickery. I was homeschooled from the 3rd grade all the way to highschool before college. I graduated class of 2019. I have Aspergers Autism. That means that even though I have a slightly higher than average IQ, I still struggle with things like social interaction, understanding sarcasm, etc.
